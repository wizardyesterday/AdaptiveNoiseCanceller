This repository contains code for an NLMS (normalized least mean square)
adaptive noise canceller.
There are two programs that provide testing of the noise canceller.

1. noisyCosine: This program lets the user generate a cosine wave of a
specified frequency, amplitude, duration, sample rate, and variance of a
noise source to be added to the waveform.  For no noise, just specify a
variance of zero.

2. noiseCanceller: This program lets the user perform noise cancellation on
the waveforms generated by the noisyCosine program.  The user can specify
the filter order of the adaptive filter, the delay that is used to
generate the reference signal, and the convergence factor.  I have found
that, depending upon the nature of the noise, experimentation needs to be
performed to achieve an optimum delay for the reference signal.

3. systemTest: This program performs the function of the previous two
programs, except that all data is generated internally by the program,
and output files are written.

4. test.sci: This program lets me plot the output of the systemTest program.

To build the test programs, type 'sh buildSystem.sh'.  The four test
programs will be in the test directory of the repository.  Note that the
program, test.sci, is not built by the build script. That code was created
by me using an editor.

The test directory also contains a file, speechWithNoise.raw, that has a
voice recording with static (from my SDR) in the background.  The format
is raw PCM with a sample rate of 8000S/s, and a data format of signed 16-bit
little endian samples.
