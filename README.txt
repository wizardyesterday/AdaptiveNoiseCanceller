This repository contains code for an NLMS (normalized least mean square)
adaptive noise canceller.
There are two programs that provide testing of the noise canceller.

1. noisyCosine: This program lets the user generate a cosine wave of a
specified frequency, amplitude, duration, sample rate, and variance of a
noise source to be added to the waveform.  For no noise, just specify a
variance of zero.

2. noiseCanceller: This program lets the user perform noise cancellation on
the waveforms generated by the noisyCosine program.  The user can specify
the filter order of the adaptive filter, the delay that is used to
generate the reference signal, and the convergence factor.  I have found
that, depending upon the nature of the noise, experimentation needs to be
performed to achieve an optimum delay for the reference signal.

To build the test programs, type 'sh buildSystem.sh'.  The two test
programs will be in the top level directory of the repository.
